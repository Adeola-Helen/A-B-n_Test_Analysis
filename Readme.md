# A-B-n_Test_Analysis  

## Welcome  
Welcome to my A/B/n Test Portfolio! This repository is part of a collection of projects that demonstrate my ability to apply analytical frameworks, statistical methods, and business reasoning to real-world problems. Here, I focus on an A/B/n testing project for a food and beverage context, showcasing how structured experimentation and statistical validation can guide product development and decision-making.


## Project Structure  
The project folder includes the following components:  

- **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview highlighting the key findings and outcomes of the A/B/n test.  
- **Objective:** The specific goals the test aimed to achieve and the questions it sought to answer.  
- **Data Preparation:** A description of how the data was collected, cleaned, and structured for analysis.  
- **Analysis:** A detailed breakdown of the statistical results across purchase intent, taste, sweetness, and texture.  
- **Key Insights:** The main findings derived from the test, including significant differences and trends across product variants.  
- **Recommendations:** Actionable steps proposed based on the insights to guide product development and business decisions.  
- **Conclusion:** A summary of the test’s outcomes and implications for future R&D.  
- **Analysis Resources:** Links to supporting Excel sheets, summary statistics, and calculations used in the project.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Excel & Analysis ToolPak:** For descriptive statistics, ANOVA, t-tests, and Chi-square tests.  
- **Social Science Statistics Calculator:** For calculating effect sizes such as Cohen’s d.  

## Analysis Areas  
- Purchase Intent Evaluation  
- Taste Rating Comparison  
- Sweetness Perception Analysis  
- Texture Preference Analysis  
- Brand Switching Likelihood
