# A/B/n Test: Food Drink Produc Development  

## Executive Summary  
This project applied an A/B/n testing framework to evaluate three coded product variations (A, B, and C) of a new food drink. Respondents rated **taste, sweetness, texture (1–5 scale)** and **purchase intent (0–10 scale)**. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the most promising formulation for commercialization.  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- **Purchase Intent:** Variants A (≈7.0) and B (≈7.47) were well received, while Variant C (≈5.20) lagged significantly.  
- **Taste:** Variant B (≈4.0) trended higher than A (≈3.27) and C (≈3.47), though not statistically conclusive under stricter tests.  
- **Sweetness:** Variant B (≈3.53) outperformed C (≈2.60) with a large and statistically significant effect; A (≈3.33) showed no meaningful difference.  
- **Texture:** A (≈3.20), B (≈3.60), and C (≈3.45) were similar, with no significant differences observed.  

Statistical testing (ANOVA, t-tests, Chi-square) confirmed that **Variant B consistently outperformed C in purchase intent and sweetness**, while differences between A and B were smaller and less conclusive. Texture showed no separation across variants.  


## Objective  
To determine which product formulation is most preferred by consumers and statistically validate differences across sensory attributes and purchase intent.  


## Data Preparation  
- **Respondents:** 45 (15 per variant, randomized by location).  
- **Metrics:**  
  - Purchase intent (0–10 scale)  
  - Taste, sweetness, texture (1–5 scale)  
  - Brand choice (Yes/No)  
- **Tools Used:** Excel (descriptive statistics, ANOVA, t-tests, Chi-square).  


## Key Insights  
1. **Variant B** consistently achieved the strongest results, particularly in purchase intent and sweetness.  
2. **Variant C** underperformed across purchase intent and sweetness, making it the weakest candidate.  
3. **Taste differences** trended in favor of Variant B but require further validation with larger samples.  
4. **Texture is not a differentiator** among the variants tested.  
5. **Brand switching potential** showed a trend toward Variant B, but not statistically significant.  


## Recommendations  
- Advance **Variant B** for further R&D and potential commercialization.  
- Discontinue or reformulate **Variant C**.  
- Retain **Variant A** as a fallback option.  
- Conduct a larger-scale validation study (n > 200) to confirm taste and brand-switching trends.

Certain sensitive business details have been **retracted** to protect confidentiality. This repository focuses on methodology, statistical reasoning, and analysis workflow for A/B testing.
